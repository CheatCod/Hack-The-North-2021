# Hack The North 2021
**FLOCK** allows users to upload images of geese on campus to our server, which uses custom computer vision algorithms with TensorFlow to detects the number of geese in the photo and displays it to the user. Afterwards, Flock adds an indicator on the built-in map system to display where nearby geese are

**FLOCK*** is built in Flutter for great cross-platform compatablities, with Node.js and Express.js as backend server.
